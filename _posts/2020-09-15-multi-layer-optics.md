title: "multilayerOptics, a Python package dedicated to thin film optics"

I wrote the pure-python package in 2016 in New Haven, CT.
It uses the transmission matrix method to calculate reflection and transmission coefficients. 
It can also compute the optical field distribution, threshold gain, and lasing wavelength for VCSELs (vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers).
The package treats graded layer by linear interpolation.
