Superconducting circuits are interesting.
In many ways, they are alike to but different from conventional analog circuits.
A designing and analyzing tool can be helpful.
So I mocked up some codes to extract electrical parameters and quantize circuits.
One of the modules is devoted to GDSII files.
Someone may consider it for layout generation.
