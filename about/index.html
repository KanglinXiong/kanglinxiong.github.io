		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
		In elementary school, I thought about the source of gravitation and what centrifugal force is. 
		In junior high school, I made DC motors and generators with copper wires and magnets.
		<br><br>
		I was an undergraduate in the Department of Physics of the University of Science and Technology of China. 
		At that time, I had to take "Physics Experiment" every semester and experienced many different things,
			including measuring Young's modulus and single photon detection. 
		I became so interested in experimental equipment and circuits and spent a lot of time in the Department of Electrical Engineering.
		Later, I chose to go to the Institute of Semiconductors, Chinese Academy of Sciences to study optoelectronic devices.
		I used to make, measure and analyze devices. During the period, I wrote a lot of code for device design.
		<br><br>
		After I got my Ph.D., I worked for Synopsys for a year, engaged in the development of software for physical design.
		Since 2012, I went to Yale University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to continue my research on semiconductor devices.
			I studied the micromachining III-N by anodic etching, and hetero-integration by micro‚Äêtransfer printing.
		<br><br>
		In 2017, due to personal reasons, I left Yale.
		Soon I joined NANOx, and got a chance to start a new direction.
		In the next three years, I spent most of my time involved in platform construction, and instrument design.
		I also did some fundamental job, including circuit design and exploring nanofabrication methods.
		As usual, I wrote code for circuit analysis;
			Like what happened in the semiconductor field, these design processes need to be automatic when the scale of circuits increases.
		<br><br>
		I read Manga. I followed Naruto and Bleach, and now One-Punch Man. I play video games.
